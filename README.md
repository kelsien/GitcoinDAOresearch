# GitcoinDAOresearch
The purpose of this grant is to support Metagov to spool up governance research projects to apply this expertise to the needs and events of the GitcoinDAO and connect research findings with the Gitcoin community. 

Governance research project: 

The initial proposed GitcoinDAO governance research project is a scoping exercise of key governance challenges surfacing in the community, using ethnographic methods. Digital ethnography is the study of people, culture, and community in their interactions with digital spaces. The goal is to observe behaviours, identify key themes and patterns, and communicate these findings so they are both relevant to the community studied, and broader society.
